# Set personal aliases, overriding those provided by Oh My Zsh libs, plugins,
# and themes.

# Oh My Zsh already provides some nice aliases, but I want `l` and `la` swapped.
alias l='ls -lAh' # default: 'ls -lah'
alias la='ls -lah' # default: 'ls -lAh'

# Some additional aliases for less typing.
alias v="nvim"
